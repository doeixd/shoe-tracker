# UI Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the UI improvements made to fix various visual and user experience issues across the application.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Duplicate Dropdown Arrows in Select Components (Shoes Page)

**Issue**: The select components in the filters & sorting section on the shoe page had duplicate dropdown arrows - one custom and one from the browser's default styling.

**Solution**: Enhanced the `CustomSelect` component with comprehensive browser-specific CSS to completely remove default select styling:
- Added WebKit-specific appearance properties (`-webkit-appearance: none`, `-moz-appearance: none`)
- Added inline styles to ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Added CSS classes for additional browser support
- Added `backgroundImage: "none"` to remove any default background images

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/routes/shoes.index.tsx` - Updated CustomSelect component styling

### 2. Fixed Extra Padding in Filters & Sorting Component

**Issue**: The filters & sorting component on the shoe page had inconsistent padding and extra space beneath it.

**Solution**: Cleaned up the conditional padding logic:
- Removed conditional `pb-4 sm:pb-6` class from the container
- Simplified the button margin logic to only apply margin-bottom when expanded
- Maintained consistent padding throughout the component

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/routes/shoes.index.tsx` - Updated filter container styling

### 3. Removed Animation from First Metric Card (Home Page)

**Issue**: The first metric card on the home page had an unwanted animation that was inconsistent with the design.

**Solution**: Removed the extra `motion.div` wrapper around the "Total Shoes" metric card:
- Removed the individual animation wrapper
- Kept the card as a static element while maintaining animations on other cards
- Preserved the overall grid animation structure

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/routes/index.tsx` - Removed animation wrapper from first metric card

### 4. Centered X Button in Modal Sheet

**Issue**: The X button in the sheet for logging a new run wasn't perfectly centered within its container.

**Solution**: Enhanced the button styling for better centering:
- Added fixed width and height (`w-10 h-10`)
- Added `flex items-center justify-center` classes
- Maintained rounded styling and hover effects
- Ensured consistent sizing across different screen sizes

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/components/navigation/ModalSheet.tsx` - Updated close button styling

### 5. Fixed Input Icon Positioning and Overlap Issues

**Issue**: The inputs in the sheet for logging a new run had icons that could potentially overlap with the input text or cause positioning issues.

**Solution**: Improved icon positioning and z-index management:
- Increased icon z-index to `z-20` to ensure it stays above input text
- Added `pointer-events-none` to prevent icon interaction issues
- Set input z-index to `z-10` for proper layering
- Applied consistent positioning across both Input and Select components

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/components/FormComponents.tsx` - Updated Input and Select component icon positioning
