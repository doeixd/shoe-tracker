## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. **ConvexOfflineManager** (`src/utils/convex-offline-manager.ts`)
```typescript
export class ConvexOfflineManager {
  // Connection state monitoring
  private setupConnectionMonitoring()
  
  // Intelligent sync prioritization
  private async getIntelligentSyncPriority(): Promise<SyncPriority>

```typescript
export function useConvexOffline(
  convexClient: ConvexReactClient,
  config: Partial<ConvexOfflineConfig> = {}
) {
  // State management and connection monitoring
  // Intelligent sync operations
  // Optimization reporting
  // Manual sync with progress tracking
}
```

**Capabilities:**
- Comprehensive offline state management
- Real-time sync progress tracking
- Optimization report generation
- Manual sync with intelligent prioritization

### Backend Integration

#### 1. **Intelligent Sync Prioritization** (`convex/shoes.ts`)
```typescript
export const intelligentSyncPrioritization = action({
  handler: async (ctx, { syncQueue, userContext }) => {
    // Analyze user patterns and device context
    // Categorize operations by priority
    // Return optimized sync strategy
  }
});
```

**Intelligence Factors:**

    // User intervention when needed
  }
});
```

**Resolution Strategies:**
- **Server-wins**: Server data takes precedence
- **Client-wins**: Local changes preserved
- **Merge**: Intelligent field-level merging
- **Ask-user**: User decides on conflicts

#### 3. **Cache Optimization** (`convex/shoes.ts`)
```typescript
export const optimizeOfflineCache = action({
  handler: async (ctx, { userContext, cacheStats }) => {
    // Analyze storage usage and performance
